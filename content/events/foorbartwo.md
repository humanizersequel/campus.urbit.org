<!---

This is a modified version of the "blog" markdown template used by the Urbit Foundation made for the Campus Outreach Program.

Tag notes:
- "title" should be the title of the university at which a given event is occurring.
- "date" should be the date of the event, NOT the date on which the event is posted.
- "description" should be a short sentence with the name and affiliation of the speaker and the name of the hosting organization.
- "author" and "ship" should refer to the speaker, not the writer.
- "image" should be an image of the university where the talk will be held
- "time" should be in reference to the timezone of the university and in 12hr AM/PM notation.
- "location1/2/3" should be self explanatory.

For the body of the text, begin with a short bio of the speaker and their affiliations. Then a canned summary of their talk, mentioning any any particularities they plan on going into. Then a short blurb about the organization hosting. Short and sweet.

Then put the same image from the tags at the bottom.

Sampel Palnet has been working on Urbit for 5 years and is the CTO of Zero K Systems, a company specializing in making decentralized blockchain n-dimensional spreadsheets. 

In this talk, Sampel will provide a brief introduction to Urbit as an alternative way of approaching software, one that accomodates natural assumptions about how the internet ought to work.

The Foobar Blockchain Association is Foobar University's premier student organization for people enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and decentralized systems.
